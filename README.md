## Description

This project is a collection of five core machine-learning algorithms implemented from scratch in C++. The models:
* [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Kowallskiy/ml_algorithms/blob/main/src/LinearRegression.cpp)
* [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Kowallskiy/ml_algorithms/blob/main/src/LogisticRegression.cpp)
* [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/Kowallskiy/ml_algorithms/blob/main/src/KNN.cpp)
* [K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/Kowallskiy/ml_algorithms/blob/main/src/KMeans.cpp)
* [Decision Tree](https://github.com/Kowallskiy/ml_algorithms/blob/main/src/DecisionTree.cpp)
* [XGBClassifier](https://github.com/Kowallskiy/ml_algorithms/blob/main/src/gradientBoosting.cpp)
  
The models are fully integrated into Python using Pybind11. This integration allows seamless use of the models in Python scripts, 
combining the performance of C++ with the flexibility of Python. The project demonstrates proficiency in both C++ and Python, particularly in creating 
Python bindings for C++ code.

## Key Features

* __Algorithms__: Implemented from scratch, focusing on efficiency and clarity.
* __Pybind11 Integration__: All models are accessible in Python, demonstrating cross-language integration.
* __Easy-to-Use Interface__: Python users can easily import and use the C++ models as they would with any native Python library.
